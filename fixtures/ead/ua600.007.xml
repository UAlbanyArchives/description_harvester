<p>On April 4, 2023, the Turning Point USA's (TPUSA) chapter at the University at Albany (UAlbany) held a "Free Speech" event with guest speaker Ian Haworth. This event was protested by various members of the UAlbany community alleging that the event created an unwelcome space for the LBTQA+ community on campus. The protest included members of the UAlbany Chapter of Young Democratic Socialists of America (YDSA) which is affiliated with the Democratic Socialists of America. </p><p>The "Free Speech" Event hosted about fifteen participating students while over one hundred students attended in protest. The University Police Department eventually moved the event from the transfer lounge, when the protesters prevented the event from proceeding, to the third floor where there was more controlled access. Two student protesters were arrested for their participation, one for disorderly conduct and the other for second degree governmental obstruction. The protest began to disperse after three hours. </p><p>On April 14, 2023, the Created Equal and New York State Right to Life groups gathered on the UAlbany campus for a Pro-Life event. The event included a television display of abortion-related imagery and group members approaching passerby students with pamphlets and questions. The event began at 9 AM and by 1 PM, one hundred students had gathered to protest the event. </p><p>Adjunct sociology professor Renee Overdyke was arrested just before 2 PM after attempting to unplug the television screen and was charged with resisting arrest, distrurbing lawful assembly and second degree obstruction of government administration. These charges were later dropped. The event members ended their demonstration just before 3pm and the protesters dispersed soon after.</p><p>After these two events, the AWSS 490Z Research Seminar class in the Department of Women's, Gender and Sexuality Studies taught by Dr. Rajani Bhatia conducted interviews for a oral history essay assignment. The purpose of the research was to create a public record from participants and/or witnesses of the protests.</p>  </bioghist>

    <head>Scope and Contents</head>

During the course, students interviewed eight participants and/or observers of the political demonstrations and protests that occured in April of the Spring 2023 semester to create a public record of experiences, resulting in audio and video files of the interviews and automated transcripts. Also included are interview conduction materials, photos and videos taken during and after the protests, and news articles from the time of the protests. The collections also contains materials regarding the response from UAlbany administration including a Free Speech Symposium from the Fall 2023 semester, as well as statements from students, the involved student groups, and the Professor that was arrested during the April 14 event.</p>  </scopecontent>

    <head>Processing Information</head>
<p>Although the terms 'counter protest' and 'protest' are used interchangeably in these materials, they will be preserved as 'protests' as the events that they were responding to were technically not protests, but demonstrations. 'Counter protest' would be more appropriate if they were reacting to an already occuring, or planned protest, instead of events happpening on campus. </p><p>The term 'counter protest' within the materials will not be replaced so as to not change the content, but will be replaced in the description. Arrangment materials referring to 'protests'and 'protesters' are synonymous with the collection's reference to 'counter protests.'</p><p>All web captures were performed in Fall of 2025. Any references to events or adertisements for products or services that occured after April 2023 should not be regarded as part of the collection or reflections of the content within.</p>  </processinfo>

<p>The Facebook video of the arrest of Professor Renee Overdyke was not included within the materials submitted to this collection, though it was linked in several of the articles found in Series 3 "Related New Stories and Other Media". Upon further inspection, this video appears to only display the aftermath of the arrest, not the preceding events, and because of this lack of context, we have elected not to add it to the materials.</p>  </acqinfo>
